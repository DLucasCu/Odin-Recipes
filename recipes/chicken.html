        <p>This quick and easy recipe will sure help everyone trying to eat <em> a bit </em>better. Personally, I love a great chicken and
        rice combo as it's super cost effective and keeps me full for the night. It's very easy to make extremely dry chicken and I'm afraid it 
    took me a long time to come ujp with this recipe, yet <strong>all</strong> of the hassle was worth it.</p>
